# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are: <br>
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL
# 4. TensorFlow
# 5. Pandas
# 

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. NumPy: Fundamental package for numerical computing in Python.
# 2. Pandas: Provides data structures and data analysis tools.
# 3. Matplotlib: Plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
# 4. SciPy: Library used for scientific and technical computing.
# 5. scikit-learn: Machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
# 6. TensorFlow: Open-source library for machine learning and artificial intelligence.
# 7. Keras: High-level neural networks API, running on top of TensorFlow.
# 8. Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
# 9. Statsmodels: Provides classes and functions for the estimation of statistical models.
# 10. NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[7]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
output = (3 * 4) + 5
output


# In[8]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60
minute = 200
hours = minute/60
hours
